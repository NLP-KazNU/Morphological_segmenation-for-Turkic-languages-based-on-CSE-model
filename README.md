#CSE_morphological_segmenation

#This morphological segmentation algorithms can be used to other Turkic language group as they have similarity in word formation affixes types as in Kazakh language.

#Kazakh language has 4 types of affixes: number(singular,plural), possessives, cases, person. 

#All affixes added to the base/stem of word

#Morphology refers to the structures of words in terms of minimal semantic grammatical units known as morphemes. Morphemes are usually divided into two groups, i.e. stems and affixes; stem defines the basic meaning of a word, whereas affixes define the various forms of meaning of the word.

#In an agglutinative language, such a sequence of affixes after the stem is called the ending of the word. Tukeyev et al. defined the complete system of endings for the Kazakh language (Tukeyev et al., 2016).

#The algorithm for the morphological segmentation of words will be the same for all languages in the Turkic group. This algorithm includes two stages: 1) splitting of stems and word endings and 2) segmentation of word endings into component suffixes.

All agglutinative languages have strict systems of word formation and rules for affix conjunction. Kazakh, Uzbek, and Kyrgyz, like other Turkic languages, are grammatically similar in terms of the types of endings. Having studied the types of endings in Kyrgyz and Uzbek, the CSE-based method created for either of these languages could be applied to the segmentation algorithm based on the CSE-model of the Kazakh language.
