#CSE_morphological_segmenation

#This morphological segmentation algorithms can be used to other Turkic language group as they have similarity in word formation affixes types as in Kazakh language.

#Kazakh language has 4 types of affixes: number(singular,plural), possessives, cases, person. 

#All affixes added to the base/stem of word

#Morphology refers to the structures of words in terms of minimal semantic grammatical units known as morphemes. Morphemes are usually divided into two groups, i.e. stems and affixes; stem defines the basic meaning of a word, whereas affixes define the various forms of meaning of the word.

#In an agglutinative language, such a sequence of affixes after the stem is called the ending of the word. Tukeyev et al. defined the complete system of endings for the Kazakh language (Tukeyev et al., 2016).

#The algorithm for the morphological segmentation of words will be the same for all languages in the Turkic group. This algorithm includes two stages: 1) splitting of stems and word endings and 2) segmentation of word endings into component suffixes.
